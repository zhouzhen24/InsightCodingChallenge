Insight Coding Challenge 

by Zhen Zhou

The program was developed in C++. The 2 features required are implemented and tested. The json parser is created based on external library "rapidjson". By runing run.sh, the program will be compiled and only read the tweet_input/tweets.txt and output to ft1.txt and ft2.txt in tweet_output folder. Logs are in log folder. If input files have other names, run insight after run.sh and set input file(./insight input_file_name.txt). But the output files names are still ft1.txt and ft2.txt.
